                <h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
                <p>The fundamental idea of AR is to combine, or mix, the view of the real environment with
                    additional, virtual content that is presented through computer graphics. Its convincing
                    effect is achieved by ensuring that the virtual content is aligned and registered with the real
                    objects.</p>

        <p>The word "Augmented" means to add. It is created by using the technology by adding digital information to an image or something. Augmented reality is an important concept and impacts our lives deeply. It provides an improved version of reality as it uses different tools to make the environment existing and real. Augmented reality gives you an interactive experience of the real-world environment. It keeps you in your place and superimposes the technology in the form of text, sounds, and images.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Augmented reality merges the physical world with computer-generated virtual elements. It is accessed using common equipment such as mobile phones. There are nearly uncountable possibilities with the Augmented Reality. With the smartphone's camera, AR adds the digital elements to a live view. It uses the smartphone's camera to present the real world's view in front of us and then put a layer of information that includes the text or images on the top of that view. Some of the examples of Augmented Reality are the Pokemon Go game, Snapchat lenses.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Now, let's see the benefits and limitations of augmented reality.</p>

        <h3>Virtual Reality</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It is a very important and interesting term. The terms 'Virtual' refers to something conceptual that does not have its physical existence, and the word 'reality refers to the state of being real. So, virtual reality means something that is almost real. It is defined as the creation of a simulated environment by using computer technology. Viewing virtual reality means viewing a completely different reality than the one in front of you. It can be artificial, like an animated scene or a place which is photographed and integrated in a virtual reality app. It enables us to move around and look in every direction - up, down, sideways, and behind, as we are present there actually.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="image/augmented-reality-vs-virtual-reality2.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Virtual reality apps allow us to explore the places that we have never been to, such as the Mars surface, the top of Mt. Everest, areas deep under the sea, and many more things that we can imagine only. It uses three of our senses: hearing, touching, seeing, to trick the brain into thinking that we are at a different place.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Now, let's discuss the benefits and limitations of virtual reality.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Advantages of Virtual Reality</h4>
        <br>
           
                <li>It creates an interactive environment.</li>
                <li>It helps us to explore the world by creating a realistic world using computer technology.</li>
                <li>It makes education comfortable and easy.</li>
                <li>It allows users to do an experiment in an artificial environment.</li>
                <li>It increases the work capabilities.</li>
                <li>Virtual reality is helpful for medical students to do practice well. It will be helpful for patients, too, as it offers a safe environment to them by which a patient can come into contact with the things they fear.</li>
                <li>Virtual reality helps to measure the performance of sportsperson and analyze their techniques.</li>
        <br>
        <h4>Disadvantages of Virtual Reality</h4>
        <br>

                <li>Using VR, people start ignoring the real world. They started living in the virtual world instead of dealing with the issues of the real world.</li>
                <li>Training in the virtual environment does not have the same result as training in the actual world.</li>
                <li>It is not guaranteed that a person has done a task well in the real world if he/she has performed that task well in the virtual world.</li>

        <h3>Mixed Reality</h3>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Mixed reality (MR) is an emergent technology that blends virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Mixed reality headsets like the Microsoft HoloLens are opening up possibilities in the gaming world for mixed reality experiences. These head-mounted displays include cameras that constantly map the wearer’s environment. When you play games made for these devices, characters can walk around the physical world you’re in and even help themselves to a seat on your couch. </p>
        <br>
        <img src="image/MR_MSHoloLens_CommercialPillar-1.avif">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>But there’s more to mixed reality than gaming. Artists, designers, and advertisers have been using 3D for years to tell stories and engage people in new ways, and now they can use mixed reality to bring 3D work more fully into the real world.</p>
    </div>

    <h1 class="heading"> VR vs. AR vs. MR:<span>What’s the difference?</span> </h1>
        <div class="morecontent">
        <br>
        <h4>Virtual reality (VR)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A VR experience consists of entering a computer-generated simulation, with the equipment providing an essential role. A VR headset completely blocks your view of the real world, immersing you in entirely virtual worlds. The headset’s myriad sensors and technologies translate your movements into the virtual world. This information is then used to determine your movements (sometimes embodied in a corresponding avatar) in the virtual world. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Augmented reality (AR)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>AR experiences layer digital objects onto the real world in front of you. AR provides digital content that supplements what is before your eyes, and that you see either through special AR glasses or through the camera on your phone, tablet, or other device.  </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Mixed reality (MR)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>VR and AR converge in mixed reality. Researchers Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino coined the term in 1994 to describe the continuum between totally real and totally virtual environments. These days, mixed reality describes environments in which real and virtual subjects and objects interact in real time — and in which you can interact with both real and virtual components. This requires a headset that has either a transparent lens or a camera, so that you can still see the real world. Note that the Windows Mixed Reality headset is a VR headset with a camera.</p>

        <h3>Applications of VR, AR, and MR.</h3>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Entertainment</h3>
        <br>
        <p>With VR headsets like Oculus gaining traction with mainstream audiences, the gaming and cinematic applications of VR are immense. VR games run the gamut, drawing inspiration from blockbuster movies, historical settings like medieval Europe or Prohibition-era Chicago, and arcade game favorites.  The COVID-19 pandemic has led many theatrical directors to use VR as a way to produce dramatic works even as theaters are shuttered, while also taking advantage of the format’s unusual possibilities that allow audiences to become characters or choose their own endings. </p>
        <br>
        <p>AR has broad applications in the entertainment industry as well, including both cinema and gaming. Pokémon Go (2016) is perhaps the best-known example of an AR app that went viral, when millions of people around the globe became engaged in a world populated with cartoon characters where reality — and the user environment—was a little more magical. </p>
        <br>
        <p>With MR being the newest of the three technologies, its entertainment applications are still in their early days. Angry Birds FPS is a spatial gaming experience that uses the Magic Leap headset to superimpose pigs onto your real-world space.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Other industries: Healthcare, architecture, education</h3>
        <br>
        <p>VR and AR are established in a range of industries, including architecture, healthcare, and education. Mixed reality technologies have promising applications that are beginning to see adoption.</p>
        <br>
        <p>VR experiences have revolutionized the architecture industry by offering the opportunity to explore conceptual buildings. Whereas clients might previously have had to travel long distances to see a 3D model, anyone with a headset and a “key” to the virtual building — that is, access to an app and the project — can experience the site virtually.  AR allows people to make virtual changes to their real living spaces: You can see what new furniture would look like in your living room, or what different colors of paint might do to your space.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In healthcare, virtual reality allows for aspiring surgeons to see the process through the eyes of more experienced counterparts, while scripted scenarios can prepare surgeons for surprises and allow them to practice their reactions. MR also has broad potential applications in healthcare, allowing surgeons to use MR-powered X-ray vision to see under a patient’s skin to blood vessels and bones during surgery.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All three technologies enable immersive educational experiences, making classroom learning more engaging and creating expansive training opportunities in a variety of settings. </p>

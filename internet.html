            <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or <b>"things"</b> embedded
                with <em>electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and
                exchange data.</em>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnected network of
                physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items
                embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity which
                enables these objects to connect and exchange data. IoT allows for the
                seamless collection and exchange of data, enabling a more automated
                and efficient world.</p>

            <p>Let's us look closely at our mobile device which contains GPS Tracking, Mobile Gyroscope, Adaptive brightness, Voice detection, Face detection etc. These components have their own individual features, but what about if these all communicate with each other to provide a better environment? For example, the phone brightness is adjusted based on my GPS location or my direction.</p>
            <br>
        <br>
            <p>Connecting everyday things embedded with electronics, software, and sensors to internet enabling to collect and exchange data without human interaction called as the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
    <br>
    <br>
            <p>The term "Things" in the Internet of Things refers to anything and everything in day to day life which is accessed or connected through the internet.
            </p>

<br>
<br>
<p>IoT is an advanced automation and analytics system which deals with artificial intelligence, sensor, networking, electronic, cloud messaging etc. to deliver complete systems for the product or services. The system created by IoT has greater transparency, control, and performance.</p>
<br>
<p>As we have a platform such as a cloud that contains all the data through which we connect all the things around us. For example, a house, where we can connect our home appliances such as air conditioner, light, etc. through each other and all these things are managed at the same platform. Since we have a platform, we can connect our car, track its fuel meter, speed level, and also track the location of the car.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p>If there is a common platform where all these things can connect to each other would be great because based on my preference, I can set the room temperature. For example, if I love the room temperature to to be set at 25 or 26-degree Celsius when I reach back home from my office, then according to my car location, my AC would start before 10 minutes I arrive at home. This can be done through the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

        <h3>Features of Internet of Things</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The most important features of IoT on which it works are connectivity, analyzing, integrating, active engagement, and many more. Some of them are listed below:</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Connectivity:</b> Connectivity refers to establish a proper connection between all the things of IoT to IoT platform it may be server or cloud. After connecting the IoT devices, it needs a high speed messaging between the devices and cloud to enable reliable, secure and bi-directional communication.</li>
        <br>
            <li><b>Analyzing:</b> connecting all the relevant things, it comes to real-time analyzing the data collected and use them to build effective business intelligence. If we have a good insight into data gathered from all these things, then we call our system has a smart system.</li>
        <br>
            <li><b>Integrating:</b> IoT integrating the various models to improve the user experience as well.</li>
        <br>
            <li><b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> IoT makes things smart and enhances life through the use of data. For example, if we have a coffee machine whose beans have going to end, then the coffee machine itself order the coffee beans of your choice from the retailer.</li>
        <br>
            <li><b>Sensing:</b> The sensor devices used in IoT technologies detect and measure any change in the environment and report on their status. IoT technology brings passive networks to active networks. Without sensors, there could not hold an effective or true IoT environment.</li>
        <br>
            <li><b>Active Engagement:</b> IoT makes the connected technology, product, or services to active engagement between each other.</li>
        <br>
            <li><b>Endpoint Management:</b> It is important to be the endpoint management of all the IoT system otherwise, it makes the complete failure of the system. For example, if a coffee machine itself order the coffee beans when it goes to end but what happens when it orders the beans from a retailer and we are not present at home for a few days, it leads to the failure of the IoT system. So, there must be a need for endpoint management.</li>

                    <h3>IoT in Smart City</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>As population and urbanization continue to grow in the following years, many countries will be able to invest in technology and advanced networks. With the Internet of Things (IoT) emerging as a vital pillar of smart urban advancement, real estate developments may increasingly resort to a section titled Smart city solutions. As governments prepare for the next generation, <b>IoT in smart cities </b>will continue to rise and transform our lives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <img src="image/smartcity.avif">
                    <br>    
                    <p>Cities of the future must comprehend the benefits and possibilities that IoT may provide. The potential for IoT integration is evident in several critical urban development sectors, including city circulation, safety, sustainability, maintenance, and infrastructure management. Maximum connection is the defining characteristic of a next-generation city. Residents and governments can coordinate in unimaginable ways. Smart cities gather and examine data using IoT devices such as linked sensors, controllers, and meters. Cities then utilize this data to enhance infrastructure, public utilities, services, and growth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Application of IoT in Smart Cities</h4>
                    <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Traffic Management.</b> One of the biggest challenges growing cities face is finding ways to improve transport. Los Angeles, for example, is one of the world’s most busy cities with intelligent traffic control solutions. Incorporated Pavement sensors send traffic flow updates to a central traffic management platform in real-time, analyzing the data and automatically modifying traffic lights in seconds. This technology is part of the AT&T Connected Corridors Project, where operators leverage the data to generate routes, recording traffic patterns and volume. Therefore, managers can then adjust the traffic lights to redirect traffic flow in any road accidents.</li>
                                <br>
                                <img src="image/traffic-movements-on-city-streets.avif">
                                <br>
                            <li><b>Smart Parking System</b> Additionally, cities use smart parking technologies to determine when a car has departed from a parking area. Sensors transmit information to a data cloud, from which vehicles may download a mobile app that displays the location of available parking spots. Others rely on vehicle input to properly determine the location of openings and direct the flow to the less complicated paths. Smart parking is already a reality and does not need sophisticated infrastructure or significant expenditure, making it appropriate for supporting a medium-density Smart city program.</li>
                                <br>
                            <li><b>Proactive Waste Collection</b>Sustainable waste management solutions assist in optimizing waste collection efficiency and lowering operating expenses while also addressing the environmental concerns associated with poor garbage collection. These systems incorporate a level sensor into the garbage container, and the truck driver receives warnings through an IoT-enabled smartphone when the containers reach a predetermined level.</li>
                                <br>
                                <img src="image/devices-to-gather-weather-data.avif">
                                <br>
                            <li><b>Adaptive City Lighting</b>
                                An adaptive streetlight is a public lighting fixture that incorporates cameras, light-sensing photocells, and other sensors to provide real-time monitoring. Also referred to as adaptable lighting or intelligent street lighting, this type of lighting system is frequently viewed as a necessary first step toward developing smart cities.</li> 
                                <br>
                                <p>Along with enabling cities to offer optimal street lighting for local conditions, intelligent lighting will boost citizen satisfaction with security and safety while saving municipalities large sums of money on energy usage and lighting system maintenance. Furthermore, outdoor lighting infrastructure will serve as the backbone for many IoT applications, such as weather, pollution, and traffic monitoring.</p>
                                <br>
                            <li><b>City Transit Applications</b>
                                Innovative bus application transit systems are another rapidly growing segment for smart city IoT applications. Public transport hubs in cities see the advantages of IoT in cost reduction, road safety, routing management, and commuter experience. There is a growing preference for public transportation with the convenience of bus routing, light rail routing, and passenger Wi-Fi connectivity.</li>
                                <br>
                                <img src="image/train-in-transportation-hub.avif">

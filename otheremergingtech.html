        <h3>What is Nanotechnology?</h3>
        <p>The word "nanotechnology" has recently received much media attention. Nanotechnology has been hailed as the next scientific revolution, with promises of, among other things, faster computers, cancer treatments, and answers to the energy issue, but what does "nanotechnology" actually mean? Can it deliver on all of these promises?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="morecontent">
        <p>The National Nanotechnology Initiative's (NNI) official definition of nanotechnology is <b> Understanding and manipulating matter at scales between 1 and 100 nanometers,</b> where peculiar occurrences allow for new applications, known as nanotechnology. Nanotechnology, which includes nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, entails seeing, calculating, modeling, and controlling materials at this tiny size.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In a lecture called <b>"Small Wonders: The World of Nanoscience"</b>
            Nobel Prize winner Dr. Horst Störmer said that the nanoscale is more
            interesting than the atomic scale because the nanoscale is the first
            point where we can assemble something -- it's not until we start
            putting atoms together that we can make anything useful.</p>
        <br>
        <p>People are interested in the nanoscale – because it is at this scale
            that the properties of materials can be very different from those at a
            larger scale. We define nanoscience as the study of phenomena and
            manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular and macromolecular
            scales, where properties differ significantly from those at a larger
            scale; and nanotechnologies as the design, characterization,
            production, and application of structures, devices, and systems by
            controlling shape and size at the nanometer scale</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>History of Nanotechnology</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="image/Hn.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology
            started with a talk entitled “There’s plenty of room at the bottom” by
            physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting
            at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29,
            1959, long 109 before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk,
            Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to
            manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over a decade
            later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio
            Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. It wasn't until 1981, with
            the development of the scanning tunneling microscope that could "see"
            individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology began.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
        <h3>Applications of Nanotechnology</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Nanotechnology and nanomaterials can be applied in all kinds of industrial sectors. They are usually found in these areas:</p>
        <br>
        <h4> Electronics</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Carbon nanotubes are close to replacing silicon as a material for making smaller, faster and more efficient microchips and devices, as well as lighter, more conductive and stronger quantum nanowires. Graphene's properties make it an ideal candidate for the development of flexible touchscreens.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Energy</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A new semiconductor developed by Kyoto University makes it possible to manufacture solar panels that double the amount of sunlight converted into electricity. Nanotechnology also lowers costs, produces stronger and lighter wind turbines, improves fuel efficiency and, thanks to the thermal insulation of some nanocomponents, can save energy.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Biomedicine</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The properties of some nanomaterials make them ideal for improving early diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases or cancer. They are able to attack cancer cells selectively without harming other healthy cells. Some nanoparticles have also been used to enhance pharmaceutical products such as sunscreen.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Environment</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Air purification with ions, wastewater purification with nanobubbles or nanofiltration systems for heavy metals are some of its environmentally-friendly applications. Nanocatalysts are also available to make chemical reactions more efficient and less polluting.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Food</h4>
        <br>
        <p>In this field, nanobiosensors could be used to detect the presence of pathogens in food or nanocomposites to improve food production by increasing mechanical and thermal resistance and decreasing oxygen transfer in packaged products.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Textile</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Nanotechnology makes it possible to develop smart fabrics that don't stain nor wrinkle, as well as stronger, lighter and more durable materials to make motorcycle helmets or sports equipment</p>

        <h3>What is Biotechnology?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Biotechnology is technology based on biology - biotechnology
            harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop
            technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health
            of our planet. We have used the biological processes of
            microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food
            products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy
            products.</p>

    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="morecontent">
        <p>Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (e.g.
            genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.). New technologies
            and products are developed every year within the areas of e.g.
            Medicine (development of new medicines and therapies), agriculture
            (development of genetically modified plants, biofuels, biological
            treatment) or industrial biotechnology (production of chemicals, paper,
            textiles, and food).</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        <br>
        <p>When Edward Jenner invented vaccines and when
            Alexander Fleming discovered antibiotics, they were
            harnessing the power of biotechnology. And, of course,
            modern civilization would hardly be imaginable without the
            fermentation processes that gave us beer, wine, and
            cheese</p>
        <br>
        <p>When he coined the term in 1999. Agriculturalist Karl
            Ereky described ‘biotechnology’ as “all lines of work by
            which products are produced from raw materials with the
            aid of living things.”</p>

        <h3>Application of Biotechnology</h3>
        <br>
            <li><b>Agriculture (Green Biotechnology):</b> Biotechnology had contributed a lot
                to modify the genes of the organism known as Genetically
                Modified
                Organisms such as Crops, Animals, Plants, Fungi,
                Bacteria, etc.
                Genetically modified crops are formed by the
                manipulation of DNA to
                introduce a new trait into the crops. These
                manipulations are done to
                introduce traits such as pest resistance,
                insect resistance, weed
                resistance, etc.</li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Aquaculture Fisheries:</b> It helps in improving the quality and quantity
                of fishes. Through biotechnology, fishes are induced to breed
                via
                gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Medicine (Medicinal Biotechnology):</b> This helps in the formation of
                genetically modified insulin known as humulin. This helps in
                the
                treatment of a large number of diabetes patients. It has
                also given rise
                to a technique known as gene therapy. Gene
                therapy is a technique
                to remove the genetic defect in an
                embryo or child. This technique
                involves the transfer of a
                normal gene that works over the
                non-functional</li>
                <br>
            <li><b>Environment (Environmental biotechnology):</b> used in waste
                treatment and pollution prevention. Environmental
                biotechnology
                can more efficiently clean up many wastes
                than conventional
                methods and greatly reduce our
                dependence on methods for
                land-based disposal.</li>

        <h3>What is Block Chain?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Originally blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks,
            that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a
            cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and
            transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).</p>
            <br>
    
           <p>A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series
            of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of
            computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of
            data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using
            cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>

    </div>
    </div>
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="morecontent">
        <p><b>“Blocks”</b> on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information.
Specifically have three parts.</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar
                amount of your most recent purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block
                for your splurge purchase from Amazon would record your name along with
                Amazon.com, Inc. Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is
                recorded without any identifying information using a unique “digital
                signature,” sort of like a username.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much
                like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block
                stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every
                other block.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, four things must happen:</h4>
        <br>
            <ol>
                <li> A transaction must occur.</li>
                <li> That transaction must verified.</li>
                <li> That transaction must be stored in a block .</li>
                <li> That block must be given a hash</li>
            </ol>
                
        </ol>

        <img src="image/pillars.jpg">
        <br>
            <h3>History of Block Chain</h3>
            <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in
                        1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a
                        system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.</li><br>
                    <li>In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design,
                        which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be
                        collected into one block.</li><br>
                    <li>The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people)
                        known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an
                        important way using the Hash cash like the method to add blocks to the chain
                        without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.</li><br>
                    <li>In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all
                        transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (Gigabyte). In
                        January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to
                        January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.</li><br>
                    <li>The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's
                        original paper but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain,
                        by 2016.</li>

        <h3>What is Cloud Computing?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>a means of networking remote 
            servers that are hosted on the 
            Internet. Rather than storing 
            and processing data on a local 
            server, or a PC’s hard drive.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.</p>
           
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
<br>
<br>
    <div class="morecontent">
        <h3>Types of cloud computing</h3>
            <p>Not all clouds are the same and not one type of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types, and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.</p>
        <br>
            <p>First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment, or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud. Learn more about public, private, and hybrid clouds.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Public cloud</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources, like servers and storage, over the Internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Private cloud</h4>
        <br>
        <p>A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Hybrid cloud</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="image/types-of-cloud-computing.png">
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless, and software as a service (SaaS). These are sometimes called the cloud computing "stack" because they build on top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they’re different makes it easier to accomplish your business goals.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Platform as a service (PaaS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Software as a service (SaaS)</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.</p>

        <h3>What is Quantum Computing?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>a multidisciplinary field comprising aspects of computer science, physics, and mathematics that utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than on classical computers.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
<br>
<br>

    <div class="morecontent">
        <p>The field of quantum computing includes hardware research and application development. Quantum computers are able to solve certain types of problems faster than classical computers by taking advantage of quantum mechanical effects, such as superposition and quantum interference. Some applications where quantum computers can provide such a speed boost include machine learning (ML), optimization, and simulation of physical systems. Eventual use cases could be portfolio optimization in finance or the simulation of chemical systems, solving problems that are currently impossible for even the most powerful supercomputers on the market.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What is a qubit?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Quantum bits, or qubits, are represented by quantum particles. The manipulation of qubits by control devices is at the core of a quantum computer's processing power. Qubits in quantum computers are analogous to bits in classical computers. At its core, a classical machine's processor does all its work by manipulating bits. Similarly, the quantum processor does all its work by processing qubits.</p>

        <p>In classical computing, a bit is an electronic signal that is either on or off. The value of the classical bit can thus be one (on) or zero (off). However, because the qubit is based on the laws of quantum mechanics it can be placed in a superposition of states.</p>

        <h3>What is Computer Vision?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Computer vision is a field of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to identify and understand objects and people in images and videos. Like other types of AI, computer vision seeks to perform and automate tasks that replicate human capabilities.</p>

    <div class="morecontent">
        <p>In this case, computer vision seeks to replicate both the way humans see, and the way humans make sense of what they see.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The range of practical applications for computer vision technology makes it a central component of many modern innovations and solutions. Computer vision can be run in the cloud or on premises.</p>

        <h3>How computer vision works</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Computer vision applications use input from sensing devices, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning to replicate the way the human vision system works. Computer vision applications run on algorithms that are trained on massive amounts of visual data or images in the cloud. They recognize patterns in this visual data and use those patterns to determine the content of other images.</p>

            <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence.
                Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
                and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."
            <br>
                At its simplest form, artificial intelligence is a field, which combines computer science and robust datasets, to enable problem-solving. It also encompasses sub-fields of machine learning and deep learning, which are frequently mentioned in conjunction with artificial intelligence.

            <br>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is not a new word and not a new technology for researchers. This technology is much older than you would imagine. Even there are the myths of Mechanical men in Ancient Greek and Egyptian Myths. Following are some milestones in the history of AI which defines the journey from the AI generation to till date development.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)</h4>
        <br>
        <dl>
            <dt>Year 1943:</dt> 
            <dd>The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of <b>artificial neurons.</b>
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Year 1949:</dt>
            <dd>Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Year 1950: </dt>
            <dd>The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes <b>Computing Machinery and Intelligence"</b> which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a <b>Turing test.</b></dd>
          </dl>
          <br>

          <h4>The Birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)</h4>
          <br>
          <dl>
              <dt>Year 1955:</dt> 
              <dd>An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program"Which was named as <b>"Logic Theorist"</b>. This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.</dd>
              <br>
              <dt>Year 1956:</dt>
              <dd>The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as an academic field.</dd>
              <br>
             </dl>
    <p>At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.</p>
<br>

             <h4>The golden years-Early enthusiasm (1956-1974)</h4>
          <br>
          <dl>
              <dt>Year 1966:</dt> 
              <dd> At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.

              </dd>
            <br>
              <dt>Year 1972:</dt>
              <dd>The first intelligent humanoid robot was built in Japan which was named as WABOT-1.</dd>
              <br>
             </dl>

             <h4>The first AI winter (1974-1980)</h4>
          <br>
          <dl>
              <dd> The duration between <b>years 1974 to 1980 was the first AI winter duration</b></byears>. AI winter refers to the time period where computer scientist dealt with a severe shortage of funding from government for AI researches.
              </dd>
            <br>
              <dd>During AI winters, an interest of publicity on artificial intelligence was decreased.</dd>
              <br>
             </dl>
             <br>
             <h4>A boom of AI (1980-1987)</h4>
          <br>
          <dl>
              <dt>Year 1980:</dt> 
              <dd>After AI winter duration, AI came back with "Expert System". Expert systems were programmed that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.</dd>
            <br>
              
              <dd>In the Year 1980, the first national conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence <b>was held at Stanford University.</b></dd>
              <br>
             </dl>
             <br>
             <h4>The second AI winter (1987-1993)
            </h4>
             <br>
             <ul>
                <li>The duration between the years 1987 to 1993 was the second AI Winter duration.</li>
                <li>Again Investors and government stopped in funding for AI research as due to high cost but not efficient result. The expert system such as XCON was very cost effective.</li>
             </ul>
             <br>
             <h4>The emergence of intelligent agents (1993-2011)</h4>

                <br>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence can be divided in various types, there are mainly two types of main categorization which are based on capabilities and based on functionally of AI. Following is flow diagram which explain the types of AI.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.</li><br>
                        <li>Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task. Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.</li><br>
                        <li>Apple Siriis a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions.</li><br>
                        <li>IBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI, as it uses an Expert system approach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing.</li><br>
                        <li>Some Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce site, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.</li><br>

                        <li>The idea behind the general AI to make such a system which could be smarter and think like a human by its own</li><br>
                        <li>Currently, there is no such system exist which could come under general AI and can perform any task as perfect as a human.</li><br>
                        <li>The worldwide researchers are now focused on developing machines with General AI.</li><br>
                        <li>As systems with general AI are still under research, and it will take lots of efforts and time to develop such systems.</li><br>

                        <li>Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI.</li><br>
                        <li>Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think, to reason,solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate by its own.</li><br>
                        <li>Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence. Development of such systems in real is still world changing task.</li><br>
